The goal of bolasso is to implement model-consistent Lasso estimation via the 
bootstrap.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dmolitor/bolasso")
```
## Variable selection with bolasso

To illustrate the usage of bolasso, we'll use the 
[Pima Indians Diabetes dataset](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/blob/master/pima-indians-diabetes.names)
to determine which factors are important predictors of testing positive
for diabetes. For a full description of the input variables, see the link above.

### Load requisite packages and data

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(bolasso)
library(readr)

diabetes <- read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.csv",
  col_names = c(paste0("V", 1:8), "outcome")
)
```

First, we run 100-fold bootstrapped Lasso with the `glmnet` implementation. We
can get a rough estimate of the elapsed time using `Sys.time()`.

```{r}
start.time <- Sys.time()

model <- bolasso(
  outcome ~ .,
  data = diabetes,
  n.boot = 100, 
  implement = "glmnet",
  family = "binomial"
)

Sys.time() - start.time
```

We can get a quick overview of the model by printing the `bolasso` object.
```{r}
model
```

### Extracting selected variables

Next, we can extract all variables that were selected in 90% and 100% of the 
bootstrapped Lasso models. We can also pass any relevant arguments to `predict`
on the `cv.glmnet` or `cv.gamlr` model objects. In this case we will use the
lambda value that minimizes OOS error.

```{r}
selected_vars(model,
              threshold = 0.9,
              select = "lambda.min")
```

```{r}
selected_vars(model,
              threshold = 1,
              select = "lambda.min")
```

### Plotting selected variables

We can also quickly plot the selected variables at the 90% and 100% threshold
values.

```{r}
plot(model, threshold = 0.9)

plot(model, threshold = 1)
```

### Parallelizing bolasso

We can execute `bolasso` in parallel via the 
[future](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/future/index.html) package. To
do so we can copy the code from above with only one minor tweak.

```{r}
future::plan(future::sequential)

start.time <- Sys.time()

model <- bolasso(
  outcome ~ .,
  data = diabetes,
  n.boot = 100, 
  implement = "glmnet",
  family = "binomial"
)

Sys.time() - start.time
```

computation time has decreased significantly
